# vim

These are just setup files mapping my personal preferences. They use a
bunch of vim scripts from other sources, sometimes slightly adopted,
sometimes as is. A bunch of them are homebrewn over the years. Though
everyone can use this stuff it might be absolutely useless to everyone
exept myself. But having it in a public repo makes cloning of
installation so much easier ;)

## Installation

Just clone and copy.
